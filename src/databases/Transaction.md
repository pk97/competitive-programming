# Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation levels determine how transactions interact with each other in terms of visibility of data. The **four isolation levels** control the degree to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in other concurrent transactions.

## Summary of Isolation Levels

| **Isolation Level**  | **Description**                                                              | **Possible Issues**                                               | **Use Case**                                           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **READ_UNCOMMITTED**  | Allows a transaction to read data that has been modified but not committed by other transactions. | **Dirty Reads**: Transactions may read uncommitted data, leading to potential inconsistencies. | Suitable for scenarios where performance is critical, and exact data consistency is not required. |
| **READ_COMMITTED**    | Guarantees that a transaction will only read committed data, avoiding dirty reads. | **Non-repeatable Reads**: Data read in one transaction can be modified by another transaction before the first transaction is complete. | Common default for many databases; prevents dirty reads, but allows some inconsistencies. |
| **REPEATABLE_READ**   | Guarantees that if a transaction reads data, it will always see the same value if it reads it again. | **Phantom Reads**: New rows inserted by other transactions might be included in a range query, causing inconsistencies. | Used for situations where consistency is important but where phantom reads are not a concern. |
| **SERIALIZABLE**      | Provides the highest level of isolation. Ensures transactions are executed sequentially, with no overlapping reads/writes. | **No concurrency**: This level greatly reduces concurrency and can significantly impact performance. | Used when absolute consistency is required, such as in financial systems where no anomalies are acceptable. |

## Choosing the Right Isolation Level

- **READ_UNCOMMITTED**: Suitable for applications that prioritize performance and can tolerate some data inconsistency. This level may be used for operations like logging or non-critical data reads.
- **READ_COMMITTED**: The most common isolation level for typical databases; it prevents dirty reads but allows for non-repeatable reads, balancing performance and consistency.
- **REPEATABLE_READ**: Ideal when you want to ensure that the data read during a transaction doesn't change, offering more consistency than `READ_COMMITTED` but still allowing some level of concurrency.
- **SERIALIZABLE**: The highest level of isolation, suitable when data consistency is of utmost importance and the potential for conflicts or anomalies is not acceptable. It comes at the cost of concurrency and performance.

By choosing the right isolation level, you can optimize your application’s performance while ensuring that the transaction’s data integrity requirements are met.
